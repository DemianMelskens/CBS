\section{Introduction}
    \subsection{Professional Task}
        This document serves as a research paper for the social physics course. The goal is to take a closer look at human behaviour within the scope of our professional task. The aforementioned professional task consists of an analysis of the social media service Instagram for the \gls{cbs}. Using a data-set with information about public posts (\gls{gps}, likes, hashtags, etc.) we try to answer two questions within the professional task. Human behaviour plays an important role in answering these questions. 
    
    \begin{enumerate}
    	\item \textit{Can we sort the posts into defined categories using machine learning?}
    	\item \textit{What information can be gathered based on the given \gls{gps} data?}
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \subsection{Goal}
        Within the broad subject that is social physics, we want to enlight the different mindsets that our stakeholders could have about this project. We want to discuss with our group how we speculate how our stakeholders think.
